# LangChain Streaming Cookbook

This cookbook collects runnable examples for the new streaming features across LangGraph, LangChain agents, Deep Agents, and framework-specific frontend packages.

## What's New

The new streaming work moves LangGraph and LangChain from low-level stream-mode tuples toward a protocol and SDK layer designed for large, interactive agent applications.

- **Typed protocol events instead of raw chunks.** Streams now use a common event envelope with a channel-like method, namespace, sequence metadata, timestamp, and typed payload. Consumers no longer need to decode tuple positions or infer where an event came from.
- **Channels for concerns, not products.** Core channels such as `messages`, `values`, `updates`, `tools`, `lifecycle`, `input`, and `custom:*` describe reusable streaming concerns. LangChain agents, Deep Agents, framework hooks, and custom projections all build on the same event model.
- **Projection APIs for application code.** In-process runs and remote threads expose ergonomic views such as messages, values, output, subgraphs, subagents, tool calls, interrupts, and extensions. You can iterate live deltas or await final values without manually parsing the full event stream.
- **Selective subscriptions.** Remote clients can subscribe by channel, namespace, and depth, so UIs only receive the parts of a large agent tree they need. This is critical when a run fans out across many subgraphs or subagents.
- **Reconnect and replay semantics.** Events carry ordering metadata so clients can recover after a dropped connection by resuming from the last seen event instead of replaying or duplicating an entire stream.
- **Content-block message streaming.** Model output is represented with explicit message and content-block lifecycles, making text, reasoning, tool-call arguments, usage, and provider-specific content easier to assemble without lossy chunk merging.
- **Multimodal streaming.** The protocol separates JSON lifecycle metadata from media payload delivery, allowing text, image, audio, and video streams to be routed and rendered with the transport best suited to each modality.
- **Extensible stream transformers.** Built-in and user-defined transformers can derive typed projections from protocol events. Custom projections can stay local or be exposed remotely through named stream channels.

## Setup

Create one root env file for every example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in the provider keys listed in `.env`. The real `.env` file is ignored by git; keep `.env.example` as the documented template.

## Examples

### TypeScript

See `typescript/README.md` for the workspace overview and package-by-package commands.

#### Terminal Streaming Scripts

`typescript/streaming` is the fastest way to inspect the streaming primitives without a browser. It includes in-process and remote examples for protocol events, message projections, state values, custom transformers, subgraphs, interrupts, Deep Agents subagents, and A2A projections.

#### Multimodal Storybook

`typescript/multimodal` is a React storybook demo that turns a prompt into a three-page bedtime story. It streams story text, generated images, audio narration, and a video page from scoped graph nodes so the UI can render each page as soon as its media arrives.

#### A2UI Generative UI

`typescript/a2ui` demonstrates generative UI where a ReAct Agent produces A2UI v0.9 declarative interface descriptions from natural language prompts. The agent streams messages through a `custom:a2ui` channel; the React frontend consumes them via `@langchain/react`, processes them with `@a2ui/web_core/MessageProcessor`, and renders live surfaces with `@a2ui/react`.

**Key concepts shown**:
- Custom `StreamTransformer` that parses `A2UI:` prefixed JSON lines from LLM output
- `useExtension(stream, "a2ui")` hook for subscribing to custom projections
- Real-time surface building as A2UI `createSurface`, `updateComponents`, and `updateDataModel` messages arrive
- Action handling for interactive components (buttons, forms) with context captured back into the surface data model

**Example prompt**: "Build a team directory with contact cards" produces a complete UI with headers, stat cards, scrollable lists, and detailed profile views without writing any React component code.

See `typescript/a2ui/README.md` for full architecture details, system prompt explanation, and customization ideas.

#### React Reconnect

`typescript/ui-react` shows browser reconnect and replay with the standard LangGraph dev server. Start a streamed run, refresh the page while it is still loading, and the React UI reattaches to the same thread so buffered messages catch up before live events continue.

#### Custom React Transport

`typescript/react-custom-transport` shows how to connect `@langchain/react` to your own backend transport. It serves LangGraph protocol events through a local Hono server and exposes a custom A2A projection beside the normal chat stream.

#### Framework Chat SDKs

`typescript/ui-angular`, `typescript/ui-svelte`, and `typescript/ui-vue` are compact chat apps for the framework SDKs. They share the same shape: a simple LangGraph chat agent, streamed message state, loading/error handling, and optimistic user-message updates through `@langchain/angular`, `@langchain/svelte`, and `@langchain/vue`.

Start from the TypeScript workspace root:

```bash
cd typescript
pnpm install
```

Then run individual examples:

```bash
pnpm --filter @examples/streaming basic:in-process
pnpm --filter @examples/streaming subagents:remote
pnpm dev:a2ui
pnpm dev:multimodal
pnpm dev:react
pnpm dev:react-transport
pnpm dev:angular
pnpm dev:svelte
pnpm dev:vue
```

### Python

`python/` is reserved for Python cookbook examples that mirror the same streaming concepts.
